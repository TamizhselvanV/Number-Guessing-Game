# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It typically includes a limited number of attempts, adding an element of challenge. 
Here's a clean and professional `README.md` template for your **Number Guessing Game** (Python + Tkinter GUI version). This will look great on your GitHub repository:
